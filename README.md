Publishing my personal Homey device drivers on GitHub. These devices had no support when I needed them, so I initially used the Tuya app by Johan Bendz as reference. Added custom settings, improved retry logic, availability handling, and tested heartbeat via clusters 0x0006 and 0x0003. Focused on stability and cleaner code.
